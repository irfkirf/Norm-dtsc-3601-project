# Criminal Justice Project - <Team Name>

**Overview:** Police, citizens, and governments could use early indicators of what type of crime is most likely to occur in a given sub-region so they can act proactively to plan countermeasures such as close-by emergency transportation and increased police presence. Prior analyses show that crime often concentrates in small geographic clusters and is associated with neighborhood conditions, individual exposure, and routine activities. However, many predictive policing efforts focus on where or when crimes occur, not on using victim and neighborhood characteristics together to predict the type of crime (e.g., grand theft vs. homicide). Our project addresses this gap by testing whether combining incident-level victim characteristics with neighborhood features improves the classification of crime type in a fair and auditable way, while also guarding against reinforcing existing inequities in disadvantaged communities.
